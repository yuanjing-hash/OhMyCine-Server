# Server Admin Web UI Contract

> Executable visual and interaction rules for `webui`. The Server console is an information-dense administration surface and does not inherit the Player's Cinema OS presentation.

## Scope and Trigger

Apply this contract whenever a task adds or changes a view, layout, dialog, shared control, theme token, or browser-local presentation preference under `webui`.

## Theme Signatures

```ts
type Theme = 'light' | 'dark'

readStoredTheme(storage?: Storage): Theme
applyTheme(theme: Theme, root?: HTMLElement): void
setTheme(theme: Theme): void
toggleTheme(): void
```

- Storage key: `omc:server-theme`.
- DOM contract: `<html data-theme="light|dark">` and matching CSS `color-scheme`.
- Initialization occurs before `app.mount()` so the first Vue-rendered frame uses the selected theme.

## Contracts

- `light` is the deterministic first-use default. Do not let `prefers-color-scheme` override it.
- Only `light` and `dark` are valid stored values. Missing, malformed, blocked, or throwing storage falls back safely to `light`.
- Theme selection is browser-local, persists across login/logout and reload, and contains no sensitive data.
- Both authenticated and unauthenticated surfaces expose the same keyboard-accessible theme toggle with a label that states the current theme and target action.
- Colors and elevation use semantic CSS variables such as canvas, surface, border, text, accent, status, focus, and shadow tokens. Page templates may use layout utilities but must not assemble dark-only palettes from `bg-white/*`, `border-white/*`, `text-slate-*`, gradients, glow, or backdrop blur.
- Both palettes use a conventional administration style: opaque surfaces, clear 1px borders, compact spacing, small radii, restrained shadows, stable blue emphasis, and Chinese-first information hierarchy.
- Player-only Cinema OS rules (artwork-first layout, liquid glass, dark-only chrome) do not apply to `webui`.
- AI 模型列表使用页面内模态选择器：成功读取后才打开，搜索覆盖模型 ID/显示名称，整行选择只回填而不自动保存；失败保留当前模型。选择器必须使用语义主题 token，并覆盖加载、空列表、无匹配、当前选择、Escape/遮罩/关闭按钮、焦点约束和关闭后焦点恢复。
- Profile 命名编辑器把 `电影 /` 与 `电视剧 /` 显示为不可编辑固定根，只编辑根内模板，并明确自动分类按“媒体类型 → 类型内分类”组织。前端默认值包含完整固定根，但 Server 仍是规范化与权限边界。

## Validation and Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| No stored value | Apply `light` before Vue mount |
| Stored `light` / `dark` | Apply exactly that theme and matching `color-scheme` |
| Unknown stored value | Ignore it and fall back to `light` |
| localStorage read/write throws | Keep the UI usable with in-memory `light` or current theme |
| Theme changes on a page with form controls/dialogs | Every surface and native control remains legible without a full-root transition flash |
| Small muted/status text | Meet WCAG AA contrast in both palettes |

## Good, Base, and Bad Cases

- Good: a new Storage dialog uses shared `panel`, input, button, status, border, and muted-text tokens and is visually checked in both themes.
- Base: a one-off layout retains utility classes for spacing/grid while every color and shadow comes from semantic tokens.
- Bad: a page looks correct only in dark mode because it uses `text-slate-300`, `bg-white/5`, a cyan glow, or a hard-coded black shadow.

## Tests Required

- Unit-test invalid/missing preference fallback, persistence, root attribute, and `color-scheme` application.
- Run `npm run test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` from `webui`.
- For a visual-system change, browser-smoke an unauthenticated page and an authenticated page in both themes, reload after switching, and assert no console warning/error.
- Search the changed Server UI for accidental gradients, backdrop blur/glass, glow, and dark-only color utilities; review every intentional match.
- Check keyboard focus, accessible toggle labels, disabled/error/warning/success states, and responsive drawer/dialog presentation.

## Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```vue
<section class="rounded-5 border border-white/10 bg-white/5 text-slate-300 backdrop-blur-xl">
```

Correct:

```vue
<section class="panel text-muted">
```

Wrong:

```ts
const initialTheme = matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light'
```

Correct:

```ts
const initialTheme = readStoredTheme() // invalid or absent -> light
applyTheme(initialTheme)
```

## Scenario: Unified Scheduling, Scoped Authorization, and Repair Workflow

### Contracts

- “计划任务” is the authoritative UI for configurable periodic work. Its visual presets generate a standard five-field Cron and always expose timezone, future-run preview, misfire, overlap, retry, and maximum-runtime policy.
- User authorization editing separates role templates from direct allow/deny rules. Scoped rules use only current selectable media-library, downloader, or site IDs, and the UI states that deny wins; Server authorization remains authoritative.
- Progressive site search renders total/pending/running/succeeded/failed/result count from complete Server snapshots, incrementally merges site results, supports cancel, and retries only failed site IDs without clearing successes.
- Acquisition stage and coverage are independent panels. A failure in one cannot blank the media detail page.
- Media-library structure operations are explicit `diagnose -> preview -> confirm repair`. Display every move, managed cleanup, unmanaged residual, and blocking error before confirmation. Never present a copy as a completed move.
- A successful local or provider repair refreshes the authoritative Server result. Partial cleanup, locked files, ACL denial, unmanaged residuals, or provider reconciliation failure remain visible and cannot be labeled healthy.

### Required tests

- Cron preset/advanced round-trip, timezone preview, invalid expressions, managed definition edits, and all execution-policy fields.
- Global/scoped allow and deny editing, deny precedence display, stale-resource handling, and mutation error recovery.
- Interleaved site progress, cancellation, partial failure, stable results, and failed-site retry.
- Diagnose/preview/token confirmation, stale revision, move completion, managed empty-directory cleanup, and unmanaged residual reporting.

## Scenario: Search Scope Memory and Bounded Transfer Deletion UI

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: opening aggregate direct search or poster-detail resource search, restoring Site selections, rendering Transfer progress, or previewing deletion of terminal Transfer records/files.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type SearchSiteOption = {
  id: number; name: string; site_type: 'pt' | 'bt';
  health_status: string; searchable: boolean; reason?: string
}

localStorage key: versioned search-site selection containing IDs only
previewTransferDeletion(id, scope, signal?: AbortSignal)
confirmTransferDeletion(id, token, signal?: AbortSignal)
```

### 3. Contracts

- Aggregate searches open one Site selector before their first request. Fixed `site_id` routes remain locked single-Site flows and do not show a redundant selector.
- First use selects every currently searchable option. Later visits intersect saved IDs with current options; newly added or re-enabled Sites are not silently selected. “全选” explicitly replaces the scope with every current searchable Site; zero selection disables confirmation.
- Persist only numeric Site IDs. Never persist safe-option reasons as authority, Site configuration, Base URLs, Cookie/passkey flags, solver settings, search claims or results in this preference.
- Retry, page changes, JSON/SSE fallback and TMDB multilingual search reuse the same in-memory selection. An old session without a stored explicit scope is discarded rather than replayed as all Sites.
- Transfer progress renders Server phases literally. Normal directory preparation/move/rename is not labeled as risk control; only `risk_backoff` displays the provider-risk message and retry countdown.
- Deletion preview has a close-bound AbortController and a 50-second client timeout around the Server's 45-second provider deadline. Timeout/cancel/error restores interactive controls, preserves the task and offers retry; it never changes status locally or consumes a token.
- Preview displays `source_missing`, `source_detached` and `library_missing` separately. Detached source items are described as retained, not failed deletion candidates.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| No saved selection | Select all currently searchable Sites |
| Saved selection plus newly added Site | Restore only saved IDs; leave the new Site unchecked until explicit full select |
| Saved IDs are all gone/disabled | Show zero selected, disable Search and ask the user to choose |
| Fixed single-Site route | Search that Site directly and keep the ID through retry/page changes |
| Phase is normal mkdir/move/rename | Show the real phase without risk-control wording |
| Phase is `risk_backoff` | Show bounded retry countdown and provider risk wording |
| Preview times out, dialog closes or navigation changes | Abort request, clear loading state and keep local/Server task state unchanged |
| Preview reports detached items | Show retained detached count and never imply they will be deleted |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: first search starts with all enabled searchable Sites checked; after the user unchecks two, refresh restores the exact remaining IDs and a later new Site stays unchecked.
- Base: a Site card opens a locked Mikan search without an extra dialog.
- Bad: automatically append newly added Sites to saved scope, drop scope on SSE retry, or leave “正在核对” spinning forever after Abort/timeout.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit/component tests cover first-use all, persisted intersection, new-Site exclusion, explicit all/none, zero-selection disable, keyboard/Escape/focus behavior and locked single-Site bypass.
- Search integration tests assert the same `site_ids` on initial JSON/SSE, retry, pagination and TMDB multilingual requests and reject unscoped legacy restoration.
- Transfer UI tests cover every phase label, risk countdown only for `risk_backoff`, missing/detached counts, Abort on close/unmount, 50-second timeout and retryable error recovery.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
selected.value = options.value.map(item => item.id) // silently adds every new Site
await previewTransferDeletion(id, scope) // no abort or deadline
```

#### Correct

```ts
selected.value = firstUse ? selectableIDs : savedIDs.filter(id => selectable.has(id))
const controller = new AbortController()
await previewTransferDeletion(id, scope, controller.signal)
```

## Scenario: Provider Directory Session Cache and Authoritative Media-Library Save

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing `DirectoryPickerDialog`, media-library edit drafts, provider directory selection, or `PUT /api/v1/media-libraries/:id` feedback.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
sessionCache: Map<string, DirectoryListing>
mediaLibraryDraftFingerprint(draft, storage): string
isMediaLibraryDraftValid(draft, storage): boolean
PUT /api/v1/media-libraries/:id -> MediaLibraryDetail
```

### 3. Contracts

- Directory cache lives only for one open dialog session. Normal back/enter navigation reuses a listing; explicit Refresh bypasses and replaces it. Closing clears cache and aborts the active request.
- Every request has an AbortController plus monotonically increasing version. An aborted or stale response cannot replace the current listing, error, or loading state; pagination verifies location/platform before merging.
- Dirty state compares a stable fingerprint of every persistent editable field against an authoritative baseline. Short-lived source/STRM picker tokens are transport proof, not persisted configuration and are excluded from the baseline.
- A successful PUT replaces the row and draft from the returned `MediaLibraryDetail`, clears consumed picker tokens, rebuilds the baseline and shows a nearby `aria-live` success state. Failure keeps the draft and shows a readable nearby error. Background polling never overwrites a dirty or saving draft.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Return to a directory already read in the same dialog | Render from memory with zero API requests |
| User presses Refresh | Make one new request and replace that cache entry |
| A slower old request finishes after navigation | Ignore the stale result entirely |
| Any persistent setting changes | Enable Save when the full draft is valid |
| PUT succeeds after a directory-token save | Rehydrate from Server, clear tokens, disable Save as clean, and show success |
| PUT fails | Preserve edits/tokens, re-enable Save, and show failure |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: select a new 115 root, save, immediately change scan interval, save again without resending the consumed token or touching 115.
- Base: open a parent, enter a child, return to the parent and use the cached listing; Refresh intentionally fetches again.
- Bad: mark dirty only from the directory button, retain a consumed token after PUT, or let a stale request blank the dialog.

### 6. Tests Required

- Component tests cover session cache hit, forced refresh, close/unmount abort, stale-response isolation and safe pagination merge.
- Draft tests mutate every persistent field, exclude tokens from the persisted fingerprint, validate numeric/path bounds, and assert authoritative rehydration plus nearby saving/success/failure feedback.
- Run WebUI test, typecheck, lint and production build.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
editDirty.value = pickerWasUsed
await put(payload); editDirty.value = false // keeps stale draft and token
```

#### Correct

```ts
const saved = await put<MediaLibraryDetail>(payloadFromDraft(draft))
draft = draftFromLibrary(saved) // tokens cleared
baseline = mediaLibraryDraftFingerprint(draft, storage)
```

## Scenario: Server Safe-Update Administration

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing the Settings update panel, `/api/v1/system/update*` DTOs, release-channel selection, install progress, or restart recovery.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type ServerUpdateChannel = 'beta' | 'stable'
type ServerUpdatePhase = 'idle' | 'checking' | 'available' | 'downloading' | 'ready' | 'waiting_for_exit' | 'replacing' | 'restarting' | 'verifying' | 'succeeded' | 'failed' | 'rolled_back'

GET   /api/v1/system/update
POST  /api/v1/system/update/check
PATCH /api/v1/system/update/settings { channel, revision }
POST  /api/v1/system/update/install  { target_version }
```

### 3. Contracts

- Render and request the update panel only with `system.admin`. UI permission filtering is not the API authorization boundary.
- Display current/latest version, channel, last check and phase. Keep Stable empty when no stable Release exists; never substitute a Beta result.
- Respect `install_enabled` and `deployment_managed`. Managed, development, unsupported and unreplaceable installs retain Check but disable Install with an explicit reason.
- Guard every state request with a monotonic generation. A stale response or unmounted component cannot replace current status, error or busy state.
- After Install is accepted, tolerate connection failures and poll boundedly. Recovery requires `current_version === requested target_version` and a non-active phase; do not accept the old process's pre-shutdown response. Stop immediately on `failed|rolled_back`, refresh auth bootstrap after recovery, and expose a manual recovery message after timeout.
- Show only stable localized error labels. Do not display release URLs, response bodies, environment values, local paths or helper plans.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Missing `system.admin` | Omit panel and make zero update API requests |
| Container/managed/read-only install | Show deployment guidance; Check stays usable and Install stays disabled |
| Stable has no Release | Show no latest version and no install action; do not widen to Beta |
| Old process responds before exit | Keep waiting because its version differs from the target |
| Requests fail during restart | Treat as expected transient disconnect and continue bounded polling |
| New process reports target version and terminal phase | Refresh auth/bootstrap and display success |
| New/old process reports failed or rolled_back | Stop polling and display the safe error code label |
| Polling expires | Restore controls and show refresh/deployment diagnostics, never claim success |

### 5. Tests Required

- Unit/component tests cover permission omission, exact request bodies, managed deployment, install enablement, request-generation staleness, old-response rejection, disconnect tolerance, successful recovery, rollback and responsive summary/control layout.
- Run permissions check, WebUI tests, typecheck, lint and production build.

## Scenario: MediaLibrary Repair and Full Metadata Editing

### Contracts

- Download-list polling must not overwrite an in-progress create form. Reload route preview only when its downloader/source key changes, and clear a target library only after refreshed options prove it invalid. Multi-line submission clears successful lines and retains failed lines with per-line feedback.
- MediaLibrary structure diagnosis is read-only and surfaced once after an initial scan reports issues. The dialog shows only safe relative paths, offers explicit full repair, links unrecognized work to identification, and exposes work-scoped repair from catalog details.
- The full metadata editor separates basic fields, classification/credits and verified artwork. Identity changes remain in the existing recognizer/override flow; revision conflict keeps the dialog open and requires a reload rather than presenting partial success.

### Tests Required

- Cover polling/form isolation, line parsing and partial results, diagnosis states, full/work repair actions, metadata tabs, verified artwork and stale-save feedback.
- Run permissions check, WebUI tests, typecheck, lint and production build.
