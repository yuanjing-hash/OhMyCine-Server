# Downloader Management

## Scenario: Encrypted downloader configuration and restart-safe download jobs

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing downloader providers, downloader CRUD/test APIs, manual/discovery download submission, download telemetry, provider task controls, or the Server download administration UI.
- Downloader configuration is a Connection-like capability boundary. It is separate from Storage, MediaLibrary, and transfer/import placement; download submission selects a MediaLibrary directly or requests ordered automatic selection.

### 2. Signatures

- Environment: `OMC_CREDENTIAL_MASTER_KEY` is an optional Base64-encoded 32-byte key; `OMC_CREDENTIAL_KEY_FILE` is the explicit/generated key-file path. The generated default is `credentials.key` beside the SQLite database.
- Tables: `downloaders`, singleton `download_settings`, `download_tasks`, and private `transfer_tasks`; every DownloadTask has exactly one durable download `jobs` row and at most one idempotent transfer task/job.
- Migration v23 adds private `download_tasks.target_storage_type`, `target_connection_id`, `target_provider_root_id`, and `transfer_tasks.cloud_state_json`. The private 115 manifest file shape includes provider item/parent IDs and SHA1; no public DTO reuses that shape.
- Required provider contract: `Client.Test`, `Submit`, `Get`, and `Cancel(ctx, taskID, deleteData)` under `pkg/downloader`. Pause and resume use optional `Pauser`/`Resumer` capabilities; metadata-capable downloaders additionally implement `Categories`, `EnsureCategory`, `UpdateCategory(ctx, name, savePath)`, `SetCategory`, and `Manifest`. Capabilities include `native_offline` and `output_constraint=none|local_staging|provider_storage`.
- Management routes: `GET/POST /api/v1/downloaders`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/downloaders/:id`, and `POST /api/v1/downloaders/:id/test`.
- Download routes: `GET /api/v1/downloads?scope=active|history|all`, `POST /api/v1/downloads`, `POST /api/v1/downloads/:id/cancel`, and `DELETE /api/v1/downloads/:id`; public source kinds are `url`, `torrent`, and `115_share`. `provider_item` is an internal-only adoption source and HTTP must reject it.
- Migration v26 adds `media_libraries.ingest_*`, `download_tasks.staging_provider_directory_id`, `download_tasks.ingest_source_key`, and `download_tasks.source_origin=user|share|provider_ingest`. The non-empty ingest key has a partial unique index and is never a public identifier.
- Migration v45 adds private `download_tasks.completed_manifest_json` and `download_tasks.staging_category`. The former is the authoritative completed provider-relative package snapshot; the latter is the physical downloader category/location snapshot and is distinct from the later logical `scrape_category`.
- Migration v47 adds private nullable `download_tasks.scrape_season`, `scrape_episode`, `recognition_override_season`, and `recognition_override_episode`. The first pair persists trusted automatic facts; the second pair persists an administrator's verified single-video TV correction. Download DTOs may expose only the safe scrape pair, never the completion manifest or provider path.
- Download settings route: `GET/PATCH /api/v1/settings/downloads`; PATCH accepts only a global `directory_token` and optimistic `revision`, never a client-authored absolute path or `storage_id` for new settings.
- The authenticated, no-store `settings.read` response exposes the configured staging absolute path so administrators can verify it. `GET /api/v1/settings/downloads/directory` additionally requires `storages.browse` and opens the picker at that Server-owned path; it never accepts a client-authored path.
- If the saved staging directory can no longer be opened, the Web UI keeps the safe error visible and falls back to the Server filesystem roots so an authorized administrator can repair the setting without recreating a Storage.
- Metadata settings routes: `GET/PATCH /api/v1/settings/metadata`, `POST /api/v1/settings/metadata/test`, `POST /api/v1/settings/metadata/test-token`, `POST /api/v1/settings/metadata/test-api`, and `POST /api/v1/settings/metadata/test-image`. Token PATCH accepts write-only `tmdb_token`, `clear_tmdb`, and optimistic `revision`; candidate token and route tests persist only after the matching real probe succeeds and the revision CAS still matches.
- Permissions: `downloaders.read/create/update/delete/test`, `downloads.read_own/read_all/create/manage_all`, `settings.read/update`, and the existing `jobs.*` control/read permissions.

### 3. Contracts

- qBittorrent uses one Server-wide local staging setting. Downloader configuration stores connection capability only and never chooses a Storage, path, or final MediaLibrary.
- The staging setting selects any Server-visible Windows drive/UNC path or Unix mount through the global Server directory picker. Saving and worker execution both canonicalize the full path and reject symlink/Reparse Point escapes; it is independent of registered Storage.
- Staging directory selection accepts only canonical signed picker tokens; a non-canonical Base64URL spelling is rejected even when it decodes to the same ciphertext.
- New DownloadTasks snapshot `staging_absolute_path` at enqueue time. Job payloads, DownloadTask DTOs, logs, audit metadata, and WebSocket events never contain local paths; the privileged download-settings response and directory-picker interaction intentionally display the configured/current path. Later default changes do not redirect queued tasks. Legacy `staging_storage_id + staging_relative_path` tasks remain losslessly executable only when the absolute snapshot is empty.
- Download staging no longer pins a Storage. Migration v12 lexically backfills absolute settings/task snapshots from legacy Storage-relative rows without probing disks or failing startup when an old drive is offline; legacy columns remain compatible fallback state.
- A cloud-native offline adapter must declare `native_offline=true` plus `output_constraint=provider_storage`; its provider-owned staging Storage is non-overridable even though the final MediaLibrary remains the task's routing target. qBittorrent declares `local_staging`.
- A `pan115_offline` downloader binds one enabled 115 Storage plus one Server-validated directory inside that Storage. Create/update accepts only the Storage-scoped opaque directory selection token; the private stable provider directory ID is persisted for submission, while API/UI expose only the Storage name and safe Storage-relative display path. Changing the Storage invalidates the previous selection, and migration v22 maps legacy downloaders to their former Storage root `/`.
- `115_share` requires a selected or automatically resolved 115 MediaLibrary whose intake is enabled and bound to the submitting downloader. The task snapshots the intake provider directory privately, creates/reuses `omc-<DownloadTask ID>` below it, performs bounded share inspection/receive through the cloud capability, and treats that stable directory as the authoritative provider task/manifest root.
- Share URL, receive code and internal provider item ID use the existing per-task AES-GCM source envelope. Job payload contains only `download_task_id`; DTOs, WebSocket events, audit metadata and runtime logs contain neither plaintext nor ciphertext. `source_origin` is a safe enum for lifecycle decisions, not source material.
- A successful, ambiguous, or restart-interrupted share receive reconciles the stable `omc-*` directory before another receive call. An internally adopted direct child uses a SHA-256 key over Connection, library and provider identity; the partial unique index is the concurrency authority. Provider calls remain outside database transactions.
- Share and adopted-provider tasks do not support pause, resume or seeding. Pipeline cancellation removes the provider task with `delete_data=false` and preserves provider data; provider task-not-found is idempotent success. Recycling an OMC-owned provider root is available only through a separate, explicit `delete_data=true` terminal-record deletion.
- Before testing or submitting a `pan115_offline` task, the adapter walks the selected directory's current provider parent chain and requires it to still terminate at the bound Storage root. A moved directory or a later Storage root/connection change fails with a safe non-path error and must not submit outside the current Storage boundary.
- 115 provider ID `0` is both the valid account root and the terminal parent outside every non-root Storage. Parent walking must therefore accept `current == "0"` when the bound Storage root is also `"0"`, and reject it only when the bound root is another ID. Directory-picker, offline-downloader, media-library and cloud-transfer boundary checks must keep this ordering consistent.
- Cookie-authenticated 115 offline submission uses the 115 Browser User-Agent. A successful HTTP status or SDK return is not the task identity authority: for magnets, normalize the BTIH (hex or Base32) and use the provider-reported page count under a fixed upper bound to adopt an already-created task whenever add returns an ambiguous body, no identity, or an existing-task error. A cached task page is only a fast probe; if it no longer contains the hash, fall back to the bounded full listing because newer tasks can shift page positions. If 115 explicitly reports an existing task but bounded reconciliation cannot find it, return terminal `downloader_task_exists` with safe deletion/retry guidance instead of entering automatic retries. Provider status `0` is queued, `1` is downloading, `2` is completed, and `-1` is failed; unknown values remain non-terminal or return a retryable provider-response error. Invalid links and exhausted offline quota are terminal errors; only transport unavailability, rate limits, and risk-control cooling enter automatic retry.
- Storage capability JSON is a derived adapter snapshot. Storage list/get reconciles stale 115 snapshots from the current connection driver and materializes the refreshed JSON without provider network I/O, so capabilities added by a Server upgrade (including native offline download) become selectable without recreating the data source. Downloader execution still rechecks the live driver capability.
- New download UI/API selects a positive `media_library_id`; `0` is rejected. Missing `media_library_id` remains a legacy compatibility path with no automatic transfer. Automatic flows must snapshot an explicit category/default route and never select the first enabled library by `sort_order,id`.
- `POST /api/v1/download-routes/preview` is the authoritative target matrix used by every UI entry. Submit repeats the same source identity, target identity, route, provider-root ancestry, source-read, target-write, and staging checks; frontend filtering is never the authorization boundary.
- The selected MediaLibrary supplies the Profile used for qBittorrent preclassification/category assignment. The task also snapshots the final Storage root, transfer/conflict policy, and naming templates so later configuration edits cannot redirect active work.
- Every targeted task privately snapshots source/target `DataSourceIdentity`, route kind/version, Storage/Connection/root facts, and policy. Same-Connection 115 uses native move/copy; local ↔ 115 and different provider identities use managed local materialization plus target import. Completion manifest IDs feed only private Transfer state.
- Download completion performs a fresh bounded manifest verification and creates a separate transfer Job. Download worker completion never performs file writes inline and transfer `ask` does not consume a downloader slot while waiting for user input.
- Download summaries expose the safe transfer Job ID/status alongside transfer phase so the download page can retry a failed transfer directly. Stage retry always targets the failed Job: it must not resubmit a completed download when only transfer failed, or restart transfer when only seeding monitoring failed.
- Download list scope is derived from the complete pipeline, not provider telemetry alone. `history` contains cancelled records or completed download Jobs whose transfer and optional seeding Jobs are absent/already removed or completed; failed, paused, waiting, retrying, or unfinished downstream Jobs remain `active`. Scope filtering and total count happen on the authorized Server query before `limit`.
- New DownloadTasks snapshot the singleton seeding policy (`enabled`, minimum minutes, minimum ratio, and `all|any`) together with their import policy. Automatic cleanup is disabled by default and later settings changes never alter an active task.
- A seeding-capable provider enters durable seeding management after `copy|symlink` import. Sampling is a short leased job that returns to `retry_wait`; it never sleeps while holding downloader or transfer capacity. Public DTOs expose only safe ratios, durations, uploaded bytes, thresholds and cleanup semantics, never provider IDs or paths.
- Threshold cleanup is mode-bound: `copy` calls provider cancellation with `deleteData=true`; `symlink` always uses `deleteData=false` because the library link permanently depends on the source. Successful `move` removes the now-stale provider task with `deleteData=false` and does not create a SeedingTask.
- Provider task-not-found is idempotent cleanup success. Other provider failures preserve the SeedingTask and retry without claiming that files were deleted. Manual stop requires destructive confirmation and uses the same immutable mode-derived `deleteData` behavior.
- Seeding completion, provider-task-not-found reconciliation, manual stop and queued cancellation all invoke the same Transfer staging-cleanup callback before the SeedingTask is finalized. `copy + deleteData=true` records provider whole-package removal; `symlink + deleteData=false` performs only the exact unselected-manifest cleanup and preserves link targets.
- Base URLs are HTTP(S) origins without userinfo, path, query, or fragment. Clients have bounded timeouts, disabled redirects, and bounded response bodies.
- qBittorrent login accepts both the legacy `200` + `Ok.` + `SID` response and the modern `204 No Content` + port-scoped `QBT_SID_<1..65535>` cookie. A successful status without a recognized non-empty session cookie remains an authentication failure; cookie values never enter logs or persistence.
- qBittorrent add accepts legacy `200 + Ok.` and modern `200/202` JSON with `added_torrent_ids`. Before every add, reconcile the stable `omc-<DownloadTask ID>` tag; a successful but unfamiliar response is ambiguous and must continue tag reconciliation instead of becoming a terminal failure or causing a duplicate add.
- Treat a modern add ID as authoritative only when the single-source response has one success, no failure/pending count, exactly one 40- or 64-character hexadecimal torrent hash, and no contradictory count. Malformed/multiple IDs fall back to stable-tag reconciliation and never become provider task IDs.
- A bare magnet uses `stopCondition=MetadataReceived` when supported. Older qBittorrent versions may reject that field; retry the add without it, poll a bounded manifest, and pause immediately after metadata becomes available.
- Legacy qBittorrent may reject `stopCondition` as either HTTP 400/404 or `200 Fails.`. Both shapes trigger the one-time no-stop-condition fallback; an ignored field is handled by bounded manifest polling plus immediate provider pause.
- Username/password are separate AES-256-GCM envelopes. APIs return only `username_configured` and `password_configured`; empty update fields preserve existing secrets, while explicit clear flags remove them.
- Magnet/HTTP(S) URLs and torrent bytes are also AES-GCM encrypted. Job payload contains only `download_task_id`; source material never enters Job checkpoint, public DTO, event, audit metadata, or logs.
- Torrent submission uses same-origin JSON with bounded Base64. The decoded file must be a non-empty `.torrent`, start with a bencoded dictionary, and be at most 4 MiB. It remains in memory and is not written to a public temporary directory.
- A 115 native-offline downloader never accepts a PT Site result. A trusted `SiteType=bt` handoff may convert a bounded, structurally valid `.torrent` to a BTIH magnet using the exact raw `info` bytes; unknown provenance fails closed. 115 also accepts supported offline URLs/magnets, 115 shares, or internal provider-item adoption.
- Unknown progress, byte counts, speeds, and ETA remain `null`. DownloadTask holds provider telemetry; Job holds scheduling progress and the REST fact remains authoritative over WebSocket deltas.
- An accepted explicit retry clears `jobs.last_error_*` and the corresponding `download_tasks.last_error_*` plus terminal timestamps in one SQLite transaction before the worker can be claimed. The Queue publishes the same cleared in-memory Job snapshot after commit; browser-local retry masking is presentation only and can never be the durability boundary. If the domain reset is missing or fails, the complete retry transaction rolls back and the failed Job remains failed.
- Authoritative provider telemetry may converge a legacy `DownloadTask.phase=failed` to active/completed only when the provider itself is not failed; this clears the stale terminal error without clearing a current provider failure or an active `fallback_unrecognized` classification warning. qBittorrent `stalledDL` is an active no-throughput state rendered as `等待连接/暂无速度`, not a Server execution failure. A later genuine worker/provider failure writes and displays its new safe error normally.
- DownloadTask snapshots the selected MediaClassificationProfile ID, revision, and canonical rules at enqueue time. Preclassification reuses `medialibrary.ParseFilename` and `classification.Classify`; later Profile edits never alter an active task.
- TMDB credential priority is custom AES-GCM credential, deployment credential, then linker-injected application credential, then unavailable. Each credential has an explicit `read_access_token|api_key` kind; Read Access Tokens use Bearer and API Keys use `api_key` query. APIs expose only `credential_source=custom|deployment|builtin|none`, `credential_kind`, configured flags, non-sensitive routes and revision; clearing custom falls through to the next source. Pre-v11 encrypted Token records default to `read_access_token` without rewriting their ciphertext.
- Runtime deployment inputs are the mutually exclusive `OMC_TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `OMC_TMDB_API_KEY`; build-only inputs are `OHMYCINE_TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `OHMYCINE_TMDB_API_KEY` and must never become runtime overrides. Launchers capture the chosen build value into a non-exported local value and remove both inputs before npm/Vite or Server runtime starts. Validation accepts only bounded linker-safe characters and never prints the value.
- Official builds inject exactly one application credential with linker `-X` into `tmdb.BuiltinReadAccessToken` or `tmdb.BuiltinAPIKey`; both source variables remain empty. Manual official artifacts fail closed when neither or both Secrets are configured. The application credential is revocable/read-only and considered extractable from the distributed binary, so it must have independent quota and rotation.
- Default API uses `https://api.tmdb.org/3` then `https://api.themoviedb.org/3` only after DNS/connect/timeout failure. Any HTTP response, including redirects and 401/403, prevents fallback. A tested custom API prefix is single-route and never falls back. Search and completion recheck always use the effective persisted route.
- API and image prefixes are independent non-sensitive v10 settings. They require HTTPS and reject userinfo, query, fragment, redirect, traversal and oversized responses. API testing calls fixed `/movie/550` and verifies ID 550; image testing fetches a fixed `w92` asset and validates status, image content type and bounded non-empty bytes. Failed tests preserve both old routes and revision.
- Metadata/download settings use non-zero optimistic revisions bounded by SQLite's signed integer range. A request cannot both clear and replace the TMDB token; rejected or overflowing mutations leave ciphertext and revision unchanged.
- A candidate credential or API route probe checks the submitted revision against the current row before any external request, then still uses revision CAS after the probe. A stale request must not send a candidate credential or the current effective credential to any metadata route.
- Missing TMDB configuration, authentication/network failure, no match, ambiguity, low confidence, or fallback-only classification records an allowlisted reason, assigns the provider category `未识别`, and resumes automatically. Preclassification never creates `download_classification` ActionRequests or blocks later queue work.
- Classification fallback runtime logs contain only the stable reason code plus allowlisted `credential_source` and `credential_kind`; they never contain credential values, query URLs, provider responses, filenames, or staging paths.
- qBittorrent category names come from the snapshotted Profile result. `routeCategory` accepts only the task's immutable `staging_absolute_path`; a safely resolved legacy `staging_storage_id + staging_relative_path` is promoted to that in-memory snapshot during task loading, while a task with neither form fails before a provider call. Changing the global staging setting never redirects an already-created task.
- A same-name qBittorrent category may still contain the previous global staging path after an administrator changes the setting. For the new task, call `editCategory(name, taskSnapshot/category)`, then re-read `Categories` and require the normalized Windows/UNC/Unix path to equal the task snapshot target before `setCategory`, `setLocation`, or `resume`. Empty category paths use the same repair path. An unsupported endpoint, failed/ignored mutation, or post-update mismatch keeps the task paused with a stable safe error; never log either absolute path. Routing must call both `setCategory` and `setLocation(taskSnapshot/category)` before resume because category assignment alone does not change the task save path when qBittorrent Automatic Torrent Management is disabled.
- New tasks use the exact managed `staging/category` boundary established during qBittorrent routing. Transfer source resolution checks that path first, then supports `staging/relative` only as a compatibility fallback for already-created tasks from versions that assigned a category without changing location. Every candidate and existing source/target ancestor is independently rechecked for symlink, Junction, mount-point or Reparse Point escape immediately before file access.
- A successful metadata match may be persisted as an intermediate `matched` scrape state, but `classified` is written only after provider category assignment and resume both succeed. Provider routing failure must remain retryable and re-enter classification/routing instead of skipping directly to telemetry polling.
- Completion retrieves the bounded provider manifest again and persists only an allowlisted scrape summary: title, media type, category, TMDB ID, confidence, match status, and file count. Provider raw bodies and paths are not public facts.
- Every completed provider manifest enters one provider-neutral package takeover before Transfer enqueue. Movie packages retain only the plausible primary video; TV packages retain size-plausible episode-numbered videos; tiny advertisement/sample videos are excluded. `srt|ssa|ass|jpg` follow only an accepted video in the same directory through a stem/language-suffix association. The filtered private manifest preserves stable provider identities, while logs and public summaries expose only safe counts.
- Automatic import requires a trustworthy task-level TMDB/Profile snapshot. No match, authentication/network failure, low confidence, incomplete classification, or no plausible primary media records `transfer_media_unrecognized`, leaves provider/source files untouched, and creates no TransferTask or destination directory. This completion gate applies equally to qBittorrent, Transmission, 115 native offline and future downloader adapters.
- Retrying a legacy failed TransferTask whose persisted manifest predates package selection must re-run the same completion verifier before any transfer mutation, replace the private manifest with the filtered result, and then continue the existing transfer Job. It must not resubmit the completed provider download or re-include items excluded by the new selector.
- Manifest paths are provider-relative facts only. Reject empty/dot/dot-dot segments, absolute Unix paths, Windows drive/UNC/device paths, alternate-data-stream colons, control characters, repeated separators, and non-canonical traversal before any service consumes the manifest.
- qBittorrent download Jobs intentionally have no per-downloader resource key: the Server uses a high global worker guard (default 64), while qBittorrent owns active-download and queue limits. Native cloud/offline providers retain `downloader:<id>` with resource concurrency 1 for provider risk control. Migration v46 lifts only the untouched revision-1 legacy download policy (`2/1`) and never overwrites an administrator-customized revision. A retry releases its lease and slot; after restart, lease recovery resumes through provider identity or the stable `omc-<task-id>` tag.
- A `pan115_offline` worker subscribes to the Connection-scoped life-event broadcast after submission. Any durable allowlisted life-event batch wakes every waiting offline task on that Connection to re-read authoritative offline-task state and, on completion, its bounded manifest. Life events never directly mark a task complete because they do not carry a trustworthy task-to-output contract. A 20-second provider-state poll remains as missed/delayed-event compensation, while a separate 10-second queue heartbeat keeps the running Job lease valid without calling 115.
- When an adopted 115 task itself reaches provider failure, persist terminal `downloader_provider_failed`. Only a later explicit user retry may delete that old 115 task record with `deleteFiles=false`, clear the local provider identity/telemetry, and submit once again. A completed provider task whose later recognition, manifest verification, or transfer failed is never deleted or resubmitted by download retry; the user retries the exact failed downstream stage.
- A completed download with `scrape_status=completed_unrecognized` exposes `Re-recognize and import`, never `Retry download`. The automatic action keeps the provider task/output identity and reuses its completed manifest before continuing through Transfer → Import → Notify.
- Every targeted completion persists the canonical complete manifest before recognition. It is limited to 1 MiB and 5,000 strict provider-relative entries, remains `json:"-"`, and never enters a Job payload, DTO, audit event, WebSocket event, or log. Recovery with this snapshot bypasses downloader construction and every `Submit/Get/Manifest/Pause/Resume/SetCategory` call; a legacy row without the snapshot may fetch `Manifest` exactly once, persist it, and then use the same recovery path.
- `staging_category` is immutable physical placement once provider routing succeeds. `scrape_category` may change from `未识别` to the Profile's logical category after automatic retry or verified TMDB override. Transfer source resolution and post-import staging cleanup use `staging_category`, with `scrape_category` only as a pre-v45 compatibility fallback; naming/classification continue to use `scrape_category`.
- Manual TMDB correction is an explicit recovery tool only after automatic recognition failed. Keyword search returns at most ten credential-free summaries; choosing a result fills `media_type + tmdb_id` and may include optional `season + episode` for TV. The Server persists no browser-supplied title/year/category/artwork and must validate the identity with `GetByID` before queuing recovery and again before creating the verified transfer snapshot. Season is `0..200`, episode is `1..100000`, episode without season defaults to S01, movies reject either field, and an explicit episode is allowed only when the completed manifest contains exactly one video.
- Transfer consumes persisted automatic/manual season and episode facts before falling back to filename parsing. A single video such as `Ultraman Omega - 09 [粤语+无字幕]` may become S01E09 only when the trailing bracket supplies language/subtitle/technical evidence; legal numeric titles remain protected. A multi-video package never reuses one task-level episode override for every file.
- A completed-recognition retry is a neutral in-flight UI state: the old terminal error is hidden immediately, conflicting controls are disabled, and a new error is shown only if the retried Job fails again. `transfer_media_unrecognized` remains a Transfer error and must never be remapped to `downloader_unavailable`.
- Running pause/cancel first persists an interrupt intent. An interrupt-capable worker calls the provider before acknowledging the queue interrupt. Provider failure clears the pending intent and leaves the Job running with a safe error.
- The same provider-first rule covers queued, retry-wait, paused, failed, and legacy waiting-action qBittorrent Jobs. Queue control stores a restart-safe queued intent; Scheduler claims it, calls `Pause` or non-destructive `Cancel(..., false)`, and only then acknowledges the state. A failed provider call clears the intent and resumes or restores the original task instead of reporting false success.
- Migration v13 closes legacy `download_classification` prompts and requeues only their waiting download Jobs for automatic classification. It clears stale classification checkpoints/errors without changing unrelated user-action Jobs; the provider remains paused until routing safely resumes it.
- Pipeline cancel is provider-first but file-retaining: the Web UI requires confirmation, then calls `Cancel(..., false)` to remove the provider task while keeping downloaded/temporary data. Only after provider success or explicit task-not-found does Server transactionally mark DownloadTask and its downstream Jobs cancelled, release Follow claims, and retain the history record. Provider failure retains the original local facts.
- `DELETE /api/v1/downloads/:id` defaults to provider-first `deleteData=false` for failed, cancelled, and fully settled completed history, then removes the complete local pipeline history. `?delete_data=true` is an explicit destructive opt-in that requests provider source/temporary-file deletion first. Provider task-not-found is idempotent success; other provider/configuration failures preserve local records. A missing provider identity permits the default local cleanup, while destructive cleanup requires a verified OMC-owned output boundary or fails closed. Any unfinished downstream stage rejects history deletion. Both modes require owner + `jobs.control_own` or `downloads.manage_all`.
- If `Submit` returns after the local task was cancelled, the worker persists the late provider identity and immediately calls `Cancel(..., false)` through a fresh bounded context. Failure persists a safe `downloader_control_failed` fact so a later default DELETE can retry instead of leaking an invisible provider task.
- The Web UI renders downloader health and task aggregates as cards; connection fields appear only after Edit. Download administration uses URL-restorable top tabs for active work, history, creation, seeding, and downloader connections. History deletion defaults to retaining files and exposes a separate unchecked destructive-data option with stronger warning. Mutations and connection tests publish bounded App-root toast notifications that remain visible regardless of scroll position and auto-dismiss.
- A card-level Test checks the persisted encrypted configuration. The edit form's Save and Test action must persist the current fields first and then test that same saved revision; it must never silently test stale credentials while presenting edited values.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|

| qBittorrent login returns legacy `200 Fails.` or HTTP 401/403 | Return `downloader_auth_failed` without exposing the response body |
| qBittorrent login returns 404/other 4xx or 5xx | Classify as request/configuration failure or retryable unavailability instead of blaming the saved credentials |
| qBittorrent add returns modern JSON, an unknown success body, or a previous local failure already created the torrent | Bind `added_torrent_ids` when present and otherwise reconcile the stable tag; never blindly add twice |
| Magnet metadata is ready but TMDB/Profile evidence is incomplete | Assign `未识别`, record only a safe reason code/message, resume, and create no ActionRequest |
| Same-name qBittorrent category still points to the previous global staging root, or has an empty path | Update it to `task.staging_absolute_path/category`, re-read and verify exact normalized equality, then set category/location and resume |
| qBittorrent category update returns 404/405 | Return terminal `downloader_category_update_unsupported`; keep the task paused and recommend upgrading qBittorrent |
| qBittorrent category update returns 401/403, 429, 5xx, `200 Fails.`, or success without applying the path | Preserve authentication semantics; treat 429/5xx as retryable `downloader_category_update_failed`; otherwise fail safely, never set location or resume |
| Download task has neither an absolute staging snapshot nor a valid legacy Storage-relative snapshot | Fail before every qBittorrent category/location call; never fall back to the current global setting |
| qBittorrent Automatic Torrent Management is disabled | Explicitly call `setLocation` after category assignment, then resume; never assume Category changes the save path |
| Custom TMDB Token is cleared | Resolve deployment, then builtin; report `none` only when every source is absent |
| Default short TMDB API has a network failure | Try the legacy official API once; do not fallback after any HTTP response |
| Custom TMDB API/image probe fails | Preserve the old route and revision; do not change the other route |
| Unified staging is not configured | Allow downloader CRUD/test; reject qBittorrent task submission with `download_staging_required` |

| Settings revision changed concurrently | Reject PATCH with conflict and preserve the newer setting |
| Torrent is empty, oversized, wrong extension, or not bencoded dictionary data | Reject with `download_torrent_invalid`; create no Job or DownloadTask |
| A `.torrent` handed to 115 has missing/duplicate/non-dictionary `info`, malformed/deep bencode or trailing data | Reject terminally before any provider call; do not fall back to uploading bytes or treating the URL as public |
| Downloader credentials or source contain passkeys/tokens | Persist only ciphertext; public DTO/log/audit/Job payload contains none of the plaintext |
| Provider telemetry omits a value | Persist/return `null`, never manufacture zero |
| Explicit retry is accepted for a failed download | Atomically queue the Job and clear both Job/DownloadTask terminal errors before claim; a refresh or WebSocket event must not resurrect the old error |

| qBittorrent reports `stalledDL` after retry | Keep the task active and show `等待连接/暂无速度`; do not display the previous terminal error |
| The retried provider later reports a genuine failure | Persist and display the new failure; active-state suppression must not hide it |
| Provider pause/cancel fails | Keep Job running, clear interrupt pending, record safe error, and do not claim the operation succeeded |
| User confirms pipeline cancellation | Remove provider task with `deleteData=false`, retain files, then mark local pipeline facts cancelled and release Follow claims |
| Provider task was already manually deleted | Treat explicit task-not-found as success and idempotently remove the terminal local record |
| Provider deletion fails or Downloader reference is missing | Keep the local record and return an actionable safe error |
| Terminal record DELETE omits `delete_data` | Remove provider task with `deleteData=false`, retain files, then delete local pipeline facts |
| Terminal record DELETE sets `delete_data=true` | Require explicit confirmation, remove provider task and source/temporary files, then delete local pipeline facts |
| Completed download has queued/running/failed transfer or seeding work | Keep it in active scope and reject terminal history deletion |
| Completed download and every existing downstream Job completed | Return it in history scope; permit the same default/destructive provider-first deletion contract |
| Server restarts during an active qBittorrent task | Expire/recover lease, then reconcile the existing provider task instead of resubmitting |
| 115 emits a life event while multiple offline tasks wait on one Connection | Broadcast one wake to every worker; each worker independently rechecks its own provider task ID |
| 115 life events are delayed, missing, duplicated, or replayed | Keep completion idempotent and use bounded low-frequency offline-task polling as the authoritative fallback |
| 115 accepts a magnet but its add response is undecodable, empty, or reports an existing task | Reconcile by normalized info hash and persist the provider task identity; never leave the local task blindly resubmitting |
| An existing 115 task moved beyond the old/cached task-list page | Follow the bounded provider page count, adopt the matching hash, and continue from its active/completed/failed state |
| 115 reports an existing task but bounded reconciliation cannot find it | Fail once with `downloader_task_exists`; tell the user to remove the stale 115 task record and retry, without deleting provider files automatically |
| An adopted 115 task is in provider-failed state and the user explicitly retries | Delete only the old provider task record (`deleteFiles=false`), clear its local identity, then submit once; provider cleanup failure preserves the failed local task |
| A completed 115 task later fails recognition/manifest/import | Keep its provider identity/output and retry only that failed stage; never delete or resubmit the completed offline download |
| A completed-unrecognized task has a valid v45 manifest snapshot | Re-run recognition and enqueue at most one TransferTask without loading or calling the downloader; preserve the original `staging_category` |
| A legacy completed-unrecognized task has no manifest snapshot | Read the existing provider task manifest once, persist the canonical snapshot, then recover; if unavailable, return `download_completion_manifest_unavailable` without submission |
| A verified TV override supplies only episode `9` for one video | Persist S01E09 and let Transfer consume that fact; do not require the filename parser to rediscover it |
| A TV override supplies one episode for a multi-video manifest | Reject as `invalid_request`; do not stamp one episode onto every video |
| Transfer still cannot establish a trustworthy episode | Return `transfer_media_unrecognized`; retain the completed source and do not report a downloader outage |
| A stored completion manifest is oversized, incomplete, duplicated, absolute, traversal-dependent, or otherwise non-canonical | Fail closed with `download_completion_manifest_invalid`; create no TransferTask and mutate no source/target file |
| 115 rejects an invalid link or reports exhausted offline quota | Mark a safe actionable terminal failure; do not schedule a ten-second retry loop |
| A 115 offline directory reaches parent ID `0` | Accept and verify it when the bound Storage root is `0`; otherwise reject as `downloader_storage_unavailable` before provider submission |
| 115 download targets a local/cross-account/symlink library or a target without live mutation capability | Reject before enqueue with `media_library_storage_unavailable`; explicit selection never redirects and automatic selection skips it |
| HTTP submits `provider_item`, or submits `115_share` to a non-115 downloader | Reject with `download_source_invalid`; create no Job or DownloadTask |
| Share target is absent/incompatible or its intake directory moved outside the current Storage root | Reject before receive with a safe target/storage error; never fall back to the downloader default directory |
| Share is invalid, empty, over the bounded top-level limit, or provider result remains ambiguous after directory reconciliation | Return a stable `pan115_share_*` error without logging the link, code, IDs or response body |
| Duplicate life events/sweeps adopt the same provider child concurrently | The partial unique index admits one DownloadTask; all other attempts are idempotent no-ops |
| Downloader has an active DownloadTask | Reject configuration deletion with `downloader_in_use` |
| Automatic target starts with an unavailable library | Skip it and choose the next usable ordered library |
| Explicit target is unavailable | Reject submission; never silently reroute |
| Download completes without a bounded manifest for a targeted task | Fail safely with `transfer_manifest_unavailable`; do not guess paths |
| Completed package is unrecognized or contains no plausible primary media | Fail with `transfer_media_unrecognized`; retain the source and perform no transfer/provider mutation |
| Auto-cleanup is enabled with both thresholds disabled | Reject settings update; preserve the previous revision |
| Copy seeding reaches its snapshotted threshold | Delete provider task and staging data, then mark SeedingTask completed |
| Symlink seeding reaches its snapshotted threshold | Delete provider task only; retain source data so the library link remains valid |
| Provider task was already deleted before seeding cleanup | Treat task-not-found as idempotent success and finish the durable cleanup fact |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: an administrator selects one Server-visible global staging directory in Settings, orders MediaLibraries, adds multiple qBittorrent connections without path fields, and each new task snapshots both staging and final-library routing before enqueue.
- Good: a 115 offline task selects a same-Connection cloud library, snapshots its stable root privately, and automatically enters cloud organization after authoritative completion manifest verification.
- Good: a 115 share URL selects an intake-enabled library, receives into `omc-<task-id>`, survives a lost success response by directory reconciliation, and then enters the ordinary recognition and Transfer stages exactly once.
- Good: a manual 115 App transfer appears as one non-`omc-*` direct child; startup/event/periodic sweeps may all observe it but create only one internal adopted task.
- Good: a 115 Storage bound to account root `0` uses any validated descendant as its offline directory; downloader test and task submission both accept the same selection.
- Good: 115 reports a duplicate completed magnet on a later page; the adapter adopts its hash/output and continues manifest verification without submitting again.
- Good: an adopted failed 115 task remains terminal until the user clicks retry; that explicit retry removes only the stale task record and preserves provider files before one fresh submission.
- Good: a qBittorrent task downloaded under `未识别`, then a verified override classifies it as `国产剧`; transfer and guarded cleanup still read `staging/未识别`, while destination naming uses the new logical category.
- Good: after the administrator changes staging from `D:\Old` to `E:\New`, a newly created task keeps `E:\New` as its snapshot, repairs qBittorrent category `剧集` to `E:\New\剧集`, verifies the provider state, and only then resumes; an older queued task continues to use its own `D:\Old` snapshot.
- Good: an administrator selects the correct TV identity for one completed video, leaves season/episode empty when automatic S01E09 parsing is correct, or explicitly supplies S00/E01 for a special; recovery reuses the completed manifest and creates one TransferTask without touching the downloader.
- Base: qBittorrent CRUD and connection tests work before staging is configured, while task submission gives an actionable settings error.
- Good: all active pipeline stages display a file-retaining cancel confirmation, remove the provider task with `deleteData=false`, stop OhMyCine work, retain a cancelled history fact, and release any Follow claim; later default/destructive record deletion remains separate and idempotent.
- Base: qBittorrent is temporarily offline; the worker writes a safe retry code, releases the slot, and later resumes by provider task ID/tag.
- Good: a failed qBittorrent task is explicitly retried; Job and DownloadTask errors clear in one commit, `stalledDL` shows as an active wait after refresh, and a later real failure replaces it with the new error.
- Bad: clear only `jobs.last_error_message`, depend on a Vue ref to hide `download_tasks.last_error_message`, or publish the pre-transaction Job object after retry.
- Bad: storing magnet URLs in `jobs.payload_json`, returning encrypted credential blobs through API DTOs, or logging a qBittorrent response body.
- Bad: marking a Job paused when the provider pause request failed, or using cancellation as an implicit delete-data operation.
- Bad: putting a MediaLibrary selector on a downloader form, resolving staging from the current global setting after a task was queued, or storing an absolute path in Job payload.
- Bad: treating a stale same-name qBittorrent category as permanently unusable, trusting HTTP 200 without re-reading provider categories, or calling `resume` before the repaired path is verified.
- Bad: treating every parent ID `0` as outside the Storage before comparing it with a configured account root of `0`.
- Bad: scanning only five fixed task pages, mapping `ErrOfflineTaskExisted` to retryable unavailability, and submitting the same magnet three times.
- Bad: reusing `scrape_category` as both physical staging location and logical metadata category, or re-entering the normal downloader worker after a completed-manifest recovery is queued.

### 6. Tests Required

- Credential tests assert key-file generation/reuse, AES-GCM round trip, purpose/AAD mismatch, and invalid key rejection.
- Migration tests cover fresh/idempotent/previous-version upgrades, legacy staging adoption/detachment, staging snapshot columns, and v23 private cloud-target/checkpoint columns.
- v45 migration tests assert both private completion-recovery columns and safe defaults. Recovery tests persist a complete manifest, make the downloader unavailable, apply a verified override, and assert zero downloader calls, one TransferTask, retained `staging_category`, and unchanged source-manifest identity; legacy fallback tests assert at most one manifest fetch.
- v47 migration and recovery tests assert fresh/upgrade/repeat column availability, movie/TV bounds, episode-only S01 defaulting, single-video enforcement, scrape-fact DTO projection, multi-video non-reuse, verified Transfer naming, real Transfer error propagation, and retry UI replacement of the old terminal error.
- Provider tests use local HTTP servers to assert legacy `SID` and modern port-scoped `QBT_SID_*` login flows, missing/invalid session cookie rejection, bounded URL/torrent submission, telemetry parsing, and v4/v5 pause/resume fallback. Pipeline cancellation tests assert provider cancel with `deleteData=false`, retained data, task-not-found idempotency, provider-failure local retention, and late-submit race cleanup.
- Torrent bridge tests hash the exact raw `info` slice, preserve/deduplicate bounded public and passkey-bearing trackers, reject duplicate/malformed/deep structures, and prove 115 receives a magnet without exposing it outside encrypted task source state.
- Queue tests prove two same-qBittorrent Jobs can be claimed together, while two same-115 Jobs remain resource-serialized; migration tests prove the untouched default upgrades and a customized revision remains unchanged.
- Provider tests also cover old/new add responses, tag adoption, metadata stop-condition fallback, bounded manifests, category list/create/update/set, legacy `Ok.` and modern empty action success, `200 Fails.`, 401/405/429/503 error semantics, explicit task location routing, and no duplicate submissions.
- Service tests cover encrypted TMDB settings, Profile snapshots, automatic `未识别` fallback without ActionRequest, new/existing/empty/stale category paths, update failure or ignored-success no-resume behavior, immutable new and safely promoted legacy staging snapshots, Windows/UNC/Unix comparisons, and completion verification summaries.
- Package-takeover tests cover a 28.5 GiB movie plus sub-megabyte advertisement videos, clean title extraction, multi-episode TV packs, related/unrelated sidecars, and the no-mutation unrecognized gate for local and cloud targets.
- TMDB tests cover explicit Bearer/query routing without secret-bearing errors, credential priority/clear fallback, linker/build-script contracts, v9→v10 route defaults, v10→v11 legacy Token kind compatibility, network-only official fallback, no HTTP fallback, custom single-route behavior, independent API/image CAS, redirect/content-type/size rejection and failed-probe preservation.
- Service tests inspect raw SQLite rows and assert username/password/source plaintext and passkeys are absent from Downloader, DownloadTask, Job payload, public DTO, and audit metadata.
- Worker tests cover submit-once, provider-task-ID promotion from tag, progress/upload/download/ETA persistence, completion, retry, pause/resume/destructive cancel, task-not-found reconciliation, local cascade cleanup, provider-failure retention, and restart reconciliation.
- Retry-coherence tests assert atomic Job/DownloadTask error clearing before worker claim, rollback when the domain row cannot be reset, cleared Queue event snapshots, legacy failed-to-`stalledDL` convergence, preservation of provider failures and classification warnings, refresh-safe Web UI rendering, delayed-response ordering, and visibility of a later genuine failure.
- 115 offline worker tests cover life-event fanout to multiple consumers/workers, missed-event fallback polling, queue lease heartbeat during event waits, authoritative task/manifest recheck before completion, same/cross-Connection target selection, qBittorrent-to-cloud rejection, immutable cloud target snapshots, and explicit provider-failure retry using `deleteFiles=false` without touching completed-task downstream failures.
- 115 offline adapter tests cover a selected directory directly below account root `0`, the root itself, a normal non-zero Storage root, moved-outside-root rejection, parent cycles and depth limits; both `Test` and `Submit` must use the same result. They also cover hex/Base32 BTIH, duplicate adoption beyond page five, stale cached-page fallback, and terminal `downloader_task_exists` when bounded adoption fails.
- 115 share/adoption tests cover link parsing and extraction code, bounded snap/receive, stable `omc-*` reconciliation after ambiguous success, invalid/empty/oversized/risk responses, moved intake roots, manifest and destructive cancel behavior, internal-source HTTP rejection, encrypted source round trip, Job/DTO/log absence, immutable staging snapshot, unique concurrent adoption, and reuse of the completion verifier/Transfer enqueue.
- Seeding tests cover safe disabled defaults, optimistic settings revision, policy snapshots, qBittorrent ratio/seeding-time/uploaded mapping, copy versus symlink `deleteData`, move task-only cleanup, threshold `all|any`, provider task-not-found idempotency, retry retention, and safe public DTOs.
- HTTP tests cover auth/RBAC/no-store, visible configured staging path, picker reopening at that path, directory-token-only staging update, optimistic revision, source-size limits, owner/all visibility, redacted operational responses, and stable safe errors.
- Web tests cover magnet/URL versus torrent mode, target MediaLibrary/automatic order, route summary and transfer phase, 4 MiB client guard, encrypted-credential UX, global toast lifetime, downloader task aggregation, unknown telemetry, task controls, responsive layout, and light/dark themes.
- Run `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go build ./cmd/server`, `go build -tags webui ./cmd/server`, Web UI test/typecheck/lint/build, and Windows `./test.ps1`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```go
queue.Enqueue(EnqueueJobInput{Payload: map[string]any{
    "magnet_url": request.URL, // may contain a PT passkey
}})
client.Cancel(ctx, providerID, true) // destructive deletion without an explicit user opt-in
task.TargetProviderRootID = request.ProviderRootID // trusts a client/provider identity directly
sourceRoot := filepath.Join(task.StagingAbsolutePath, task.ScrapeCategory) // breaks after manual reclassification
client.Resume(ctx, providerID) // wrong after editCategory success without re-reading category state
queue.Control(actor, jobID, "retry", request) // wrong when only Job errors are cleared and DownloadTask keeps its terminal error

if current == "" || current == "0" { // rejects valid descendants of account root 0
    return ErrOutsideStorage
}
```

#### Correct

```go
encrypted, err := credentials.Encrypt("download-task:"+taskID+":source", sourceJSON)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
queue.EnqueueWith(EnqueueJobInput{
    Payload: downloadJobPayload{DownloadTaskID: taskID},
}, func(tx *gorm.DB, job models.Job) error {
    return tx.Create(&models.DownloadTask{ID: taskID, JobID: job.ID, SourceCiphertext: encrypted}).Error
})

// Snapshot the validated global absolute staging directory at enqueue.
task.StagingAbsolutePath = settings.AbsolutePath

// A legacy task may promote only its own validated Storage-relative snapshot;
// never substitute the current global default. Provider category repair is
// followed by a fresh Categories read before SetCategory/SetLocation/Resume.
task.StagingAbsolutePath = resolvedLegacySnapshot

// Keep physical placement separate from classification. A later manual match
// may change ScrapeCategory, but transfer and cleanup still use this snapshot.
task.StagingCategory = assignedProviderCategory

// An explicit retry changes the generic Job and its domain read model in one
// transaction; the event snapshot is updated to the same cleared state.
retryJobAndResetDownloadTask(tx, job, now)

// Persist the bounded canonical provider-relative manifest before recognition.
completedManifestJSON, err := encodeCompletedDownloadManifest(manifest)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
task.CompletedManifestJSON = completedManifestJSON

// Resolve from the selected library and current driver; persist privately.
target, err := downloads.snapshotDownloadTarget(ctx, downloader, library)

// Default deletion is provider-first and retains files. A separate explicit
// destructive option passes true. Local facts are deleted only after provider
// success or explicit task-not-found.
client.Cancel(ctx, providerID, deleteData)

if current == "" || (current == "0" && rootID != "0") {
    return ErrOutsideStorage
}
```

## Scenario: Authoritative Media Identity and Optional AI Adjudication

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing download/search/library recognition, confidence behavior, manual TMDB correction, episode facts, AI recognition settings/providers, or any recognition-to-Transfer handoff.

### 2. Signatures

```text
DB migration v48 DownloadTask:
  identity_source, identity_status, identity_locked,
  identity_revision, identity_snapshot_json

MediaIdentitySnapshot v1:
  revision, source, status, locked, tmdb_id, media_type, title, year,
  category, confidence, season, episode, per-file episode facts

GET/PATCH /api/v1/settings/ai-recognition
POST      /api/v1/settings/ai-recognition/test
POST      /api/v1/settings/ai-recognition/models
```

- `identity_source` is `manual|direct_id|automatic|ai|local_provisional`; status is `verified|provisional|local_provisional`.
- The versioned score config owns all thresholds. `ExtremeThreshold=0.35` is the only floor that withholds an unrelated candidate; handlers, workers and Transfer must not add another confidence gate.

### 3. Contracts

- One download owns one advancing identity revision from search/preclassification through completion and Transfer. Completion may add immutable manifest/episode facts, but it does not run a third independent identity search.
- Non-plugin Transfer must strictly decode the identity snapshot and require its revision, source/status/lock, TMDB ID, media type, title and category projection to match the DownloadTask columns. Legacy automatic tasks that have only the old scrape TMDB/type columns get one `GetByID`-verified automatic binding and a full snapshot on their next recognition pass; this migration fallback never creates a manual lock.
- A manually selected `tmdb_id + movie|tv` is `GetByID`-verified, stored as `manual + verified + locked`, and cannot be replaced by automatic or AI work. An automatically/AI-bound Site result keeps its actual source/status and is never promoted to a manual lock merely because its TMDB ID crossed the opaque claim.
- High-confidence results are verified. Ordinary low/conflict results deterministically select the stable top candidate and continue as provisional. AI disabled means zero runtime provider creation, key decryption and requests. With AI enabled, low/conflict may execute one candidate arbitration and extreme/no-candidate may execute one title rewrite per revision; failure falls back to deterministic top or local provisional.
- AI arbitration may choose only an input `candidate_ref`. Rewrite may return at most five bounded TMDB queries and no TMDB ID/URL. Both protocols use strict schemas, reject unknown/trailing fields, and treat titles/basenames as untrusted data.
- OpenAI-compatible Base URL uses the controlled HTTP client; Google AI Studio uses the fixed official origin. API Key is AES-GCM encrypted and ordinary settings responses expose configured state only. Relative basenames are sent only under the explicit setting; absolute paths, provider IDs, magnets, torrent URLs, credentials and download context are never sent.
- TV package facts come from the shared episode resolver. `[01]`, `[01v2]`, `EP01`, `S01E01`, and package sequences are valid only with TV/release evidence; year, resolution and bit-depth tokens are not episodes. A multi-video TV package with unresolved episode mapping fails as `transfer_episode_unrecognized` and retains the complete source instead of selecting the largest video.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Manual locked identity exists | Revalidate the exact ID; preserve source/revision/lock and skip automatic/AI replacement |
| Automatic Site identity is carried into DownloadTask | Preserve `automatic|ai` and verified/provisional with `locked=false`; do not populate legacy manual override fields |
| Best candidate is above extreme floor but below normal threshold/tied | Select stable top, mark provisional, continue |
| Candidate total/title similarity is below 0.35 or no candidates exist | AI rewrite once when enabled; otherwise create local provisional without blocking queue |
| AI disabled | No key decryption, provider construction, model request, arbitration or rewrite |
| AI output invents candidate, ID, URL, field or invalid episode range | Reject output and use deterministic safe fallback |
| TV package has multiple videos and no trustworthy per-file episode facts | Return `transfer_episode_unrecognized`; create no partial Transfer |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: user manually identifies episode 6 once; retries and Transfer reuse that locked revision without downloader resubmission.
- Good: Site quick recognition binds a verified automatic TMDB identity; DownloadTask keeps it unlocked and completion re-fetches that ID only to project current Profile category and episode facts.
- Base: AI is off and two candidates tie; rank/popularity/votes/media type/stable TMDB ID select one provisional result deterministically.
- Bad: `if confidence < .80 { fail }` in Transfer, treating an automatic Site match as manual, or sending a staging path/magnet to an AI provider.

### 6. Tests Required

- Migration tests cover v48/v49 fresh, upgrade and idempotent schema/defaults/backfill.
- Ranker tests cover 0.35/0.64/0.68/0.78 boundaries, equal scores and input-order independence.
- Cross-stage tests prove automatic versus manual source/lock semantics, one revision through retry/completion/Transfer, and no downloader call after manual completion recovery.
- Transfer tests reject missing/corrupt snapshots, revision drift and projection drift; legacy automatic tests prove exact-ID backfill performs no new fuzzy search.
- AI tests cover both protocols, disabled zero-call behavior, one arbitration/one rewrite limits, strict schema/candidate refs, SSRF/redirect/body limits, encrypted reveal permission and every fallback.
- Episode tests cover positive anime/release patterns, year/resolution/bit-depth negatives, ten-episode package completeness and fail-closed unresolved multi-video TV.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```go
task.IdentityLocked = recognition.TMDBID != nil // automatic result becomes manual
if task.ScrapeConfidence < .80 { return ErrUnrecognized }
```

Correct:

```go
task.IdentitySource = recognition.Source
task.IdentityLocked = recognition.Source == "manual"
// Confidence ranks and labels; only structural/file safety can stop Transfer.
```

## Bounded manual batch submission

- Manual URL, magnet and share submission may accept at most 50 non-empty, order-preserving deduplicated lines.
- The batch service invokes the existing single-item `Submit` path for every line so permissions, downloader/source compatibility, route snapshots, encryption, audit and queue semantics cannot diverge.
- Results retain input indexes and safe error codes but never echo source text or ciphertext. One failed line does not roll back successful independent submissions.
- Service and Web UI tests cover whitespace, duplicates, limits, partial success and source redaction.

## Scenario: qBittorrent reconnect state and managed-tag lifecycle

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Applies to qBittorrent submission identity handoff, temporary monitoring failures, managed `omc-*` tag cleanup, startup reconciliation, and download-state presentation.

### 2. Signatures

```go
type ManagedTagCleaner interface {
    DeleteManagedTag(context.Context, string) error
}

func (*qbittorrent.Client) DeleteManagedTag(ctx context.Context, tag string) error
func (*DownloadService) ReconcileManagedProviderTags(ctx context.Context, limit int) (int, error)
```

- Private durable fields: `download_tasks.provider_task_id`, `provider_tag`, `provider_status`, `last_error_code`, and `last_error_message`.
- qBittorrent call: `POST /api/v2/torrents/deleteTags` with one validated `tags=omc-<UUID>` value.

### 3. Contracts

- `omc-<DownloadTask UUID>` is a private idempotency/adoption label, not a permanent torrent classification.
- The tag must remain until a real qBittorrent hash is durably stored. After that handoff, exact tag-definition deletion is best-effort and never deletes the torrent or its files.
- Only an exact `omc-<UUID>` passes adapter validation. User tags, comma/newline lists, malformed UUIDs, or prefixed/suffixed composites are rejected locally.
- Clear `provider_tag` only after upstream deletion succeeds. If another cleanup path already changed the row, refresh the durable marker into the current Worker snapshot to avoid stale repeated calls.
- Cleanup failure retains the marker for bounded later retry and cannot fail download, seeding, transfer, or import.
- Startup reconciliation is bounded to at most 500 requested rows, skips unavailable downloader instances after their first failure, and does not block Server startup.
- While an established qBittorrent hash is temporarily unreachable, public status is `provider_status=unavailable` with a safe reconnect message; the Web UI renders “等待下载器恢复”, not “重试下载”.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Empty, `tag:*`, or absent provider identity | Do not delete the managed tag |
| Exact `omc-<UUID>` + real hash | Call `deleteTags` for that exact tag only |
| User/malformed/multi-tag input | `downloader_request_invalid`; make no HTTP request |
| qBittorrent cleanup unavailable | Keep `provider_tag`; log safe warning; continue pipeline |
| Remote cleanup succeeds, DB marker already cleared | Refresh local snapshot to empty; do not repeat deletion |
| Retryable `Get` outage with real hash | Persist safe unavailable status and continue same-hash monitoring |
| Authentication/task-not-found/provider-failed | Do not convert to reconnect wait unless the adapter explicitly classifies it retryable and compatible |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: submit creates `omc-UUID`, adoption stores the hash, cleanup removes only the label, and a qBittorrent restart resumes the same torrent.
- Base: cleanup fails while qBittorrent is down; download monitoring later retries cleanup or bounded startup reconciliation handles it.
- Bad: delete the tag before hash persistence, clear the marker before upstream success, delete all `omc-*` labels by enumeration, touch torrent data, or display a reconnect as a new download retry.

### 6. Tests Required

- Adapter tests assert exact URL/form data for one valid UUID tag and zero requests for user, malformed, comma, or newline tags.
- Service tests assert failure retains the marker, success clears it, concurrent marker convergence refreshes the Worker snapshot, and startup cleanup is bounded.
- Worker tests assert repeated outages do not increase Job attempts or call Submit and successful telemetry clears the temporary reconnect diagnostic.
- Web UI tests assert `provider_status=unavailable` maps to the warning presentation and suppresses the retry-download action.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```go
client.DeleteManagedTag(ctx, task.ProviderTag) // before provider_task_id is a real hash
task.ProviderTag = ""                         // before upstream success
```

Correct:

```go
if isEstablishedProviderTask(task.ProviderTaskID) {
    if err := cleaner.DeleteManagedTag(ctx, task.ProviderTag); err == nil {
        clearMarkerWithIdentityCAS(task.ID, task.ProviderTaskID, task.ProviderTag)
    }
}
```
